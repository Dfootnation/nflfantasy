check how players compare without ppr
e.g standard, .5 ppr

things I could look at 
WR vs RB vs TE at each level
rank them to see which is worth the most for drafting purposes

look for outliers to draft e.g. travis kelce, top qbs



Team of the week
have some positional based queries to find out the best players in fantasy each week and create the best team each week

e.g. For week 1
QB
SELECT * from Fantasy_score WHERE Position = 'QB' AND Week = 1 ORDER BY Fantasy_points DESC LIMIT 1;
RB
SELECT * from Fantasy_score WHERE Position = 'RB' AND Week = 1 ORDER BY Fantasy_points DESC LIMIT 2;
WR
SELECT * from Fantasy_score WHERE Position = 'WR' AND Week = 1 ORDER BY Fantasy_points DESC LIMIT 2;
TE
SELECT * from Fantasy_score WHERE Position = 'TE' AND Week = 1 ORDER BY Fantasy_points DESC LIMIT 1;
RB/WR
SELECT * from Fantasy_score WHERE Position = 'RB' OR 'WR' AND Week = 1 ORDER BY Fantasy_points DESC LIMIT 1;
Or
SELECT * from Fantasy_score WHERE Position = 'RB' AND Week = 1 ORDER BY Fantasy_points DESC LIMIT 1;


SELECT * FROM (SELECT * from Fantasy_score WHERE Position = 'QB' AND Week = 1 ORDER BY Fantasy_points DESC) ORDER BY Fantasy_points DESC LIMIT 1;

SELECT * FROM (SELECT * from Fantasy_score WHERE Position = 'QB' AND Week = 1 ORDER BY Fantasy_points DESC) ORDER BY Fantasy_points DESC LIMIT 1;
